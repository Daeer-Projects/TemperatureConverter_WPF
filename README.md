# TemperatureConverter_WPF
A basic WPF version of the basic temperature converter.

This version was created as a simple WPF application.  It was still created before I started my career.

The application is written using NO patterns.  So, don't expect to see any MVVM pattern or bindings.

I have some ideas of how to improve the converter and I will add the repository at a later time.

For all of the details on the conversion calculations, see the "formula.txt" file.
